-- 2c. Challenge Question: Are there any specialties that appear in the prescriber table that have no associated prescriptions in the prescription table?

-- 2d. Difficult Bonus: Do not attempt until you have solved all other problems! For each specialty, report the percentage of total claims by that specialty which are for opioids. Which specialties have a high percentage of opioids?

-- 3a. Which drug (generic_name) had the highest total drug cost?

SELECT
	generic_name,

-- 4a. For each drug in the drug table, return the drug name and then a column named 'drug_type' which says 'opioid' for drugs which have opioid_drug_flag = 'Y', says 'antibiotic' for those drugs which have antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y', and says 'neither' for all other drugs.

SELECT 
	drug_name, 
	CASE 
		WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'opioid'
		WHEN antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y' THEN 'antibiotic'
		ELSE 'neither' 
	END AS drug_type
FROM drug;

-- 4b. Building off of the query you wrote for part a, determine whether more was spent (total_drug_cost) on opioids or on antibiotics. Hint: Format the total costs as MONEY for easier comparision.

SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN drug.opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
		THEN 'opioid'
		WHEN drug.antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y'

-- 6a. Find all rows in the prescription table where total_claims is at least 3000. Report the drug_name and the total_claim_count.

SELECT drug_name, total_claim_count
FROM prescription
WHERE total_claim_count>=3000;

-- 6b. For each instance that you found in part a, add a column that indicates whether the drug is an opioid.

SELECT drug_name, total_claim_count,
CASE
	WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
	THEN 'Y'
	ELSE 'N'
END AS opioid
FROM prescription
LEFT JOIN drug
USING (drug_name)
WHERE total_claim_count>=3000;

-- 6c. Add another column to you answer from the previous part which gives the prescriber first and last name associated with each row.

SELECT prescription.drug_name, total_claim_count, nppes_provider_last_org_name, nppes_provider_first_name,
CASE
	WHEN opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'

-- 7. The goal of this exercise is to generate a full list of all pain management specialists in Nashville and the number of claims they had for each opioid. Hint: The results from all 3 parts will have 637 rows.

SELECT npi,
	prescriber.nppes_provider_last_org_name, 
	prescriber.nppes_provider_first_name
FROM prescriber
WHERE specialty_description IN ('Pain Management')
	AND nppes_provider_city ILIKE 'Nashville'

-- There are 7 pain management specialists in the Nashville area.

-- 7a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management) in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). Warning: Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.
	
SELECT npi, drug_name, specialty_description, nppes_provider_city
FROM prescription
LEFT JOIN drug
USING (drug_name)
LEFT JOIN prescriber
USING (npi)
WHERE specialty_description IN ('Pain Management')
	AND nppes_provider_city ILIKE 'Nashville'
	AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';


-- OPTION A: 35 rows with this one

SELECT 
	prescriber.nppes_provider_last_org_name, 
	prescriber.nppes_provider_first_name,
	npi,
	drug_name
FROM prescriber
LEFT JOIN prescription
USING (npi)
LEFT JOIN drug
USING (drug_name)
WHERE specialty_description iLIKE '%Pain Management%'
AND nppes_provider_city iLIKE '%Nashville%'
AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'

-- OPTION B: 44 rows with this one

-- 7b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).

SELECT 
	prescriber.nppes_provider_last_org_name, 
	prescriber.nppes_provider_first_name,
	npi,
	drug_name, 
	total_claim_count
FROM drug 
FULL JOIN prescription
USING (drug_name)
FULL JOIN prescriber
USING (npi)
WHERE specialty_description iLIKE '%Pain Management%'
AND nppes_provider_city iLIKE '%Nashville%'
AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'

-- 7c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.
